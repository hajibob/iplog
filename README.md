# iplog
python script for logging and checking IP

+ pulls from [ifconfig.me](https://ifconfig.me)

+ getting the file in `/var/logs` is tricky because it wants to add a `\n` if you edit it

+ flags `>> BAD IP` if it matches one already logged



# TODO
+ [ ] Add colors
+ [ ] Fix install method
+ [ ] fix problems with blank line
+ [ ] fix problem with "\n" first run
+ [ ] make pretty
